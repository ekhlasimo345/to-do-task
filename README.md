# Code review May 14th 2025

The code is readable and works after fixing an unclosed tag
I added the code for the conditional styling that strikes through the text when checked and changed the submitNewTodo function to use spread operator instead of concat. Both approaches are exchangeable but in React is more typical to save changes.
Yo can find my comments right in the code
Now you only need to add the delete button to complete the exercise
Good job, keep coding!
